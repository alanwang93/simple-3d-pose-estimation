### Thanks for your interest in our research!

#### If you have problems running our code, please include

1. Your operating system
2. Your tensorflow version
3. Your python version
4. The stack trace of the error that you see

#### If you are looking for ways to extend our work such as 
* handling videos as input
* large-scale deployment, or
* handling missing data

then let us know **what you have tried** and **exactly what failed**, otherwise it is hard to help!

Our primary goal in releasing this code is to make our research reproducible, so please note that we might not be able to help you if the question you are asking requires additional significant engineering or research effort.
